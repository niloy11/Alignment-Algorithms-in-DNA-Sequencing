# Alignment-Algorithms-in-DNA-Sequencing
This project involves building a system that can calculate matching scores between two DNA sequences of lengths up to 12,500 base pairs. We have successfully tested our system with actual DNA sequences from GenBank and verified growth rate of O(N2).

In this project my contribution is mainly in algorithm analysis and testing with DNA sequences from GenBank to verify time complexity, matching scores.
